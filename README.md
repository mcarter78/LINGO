#### Technology

1. HTML
2. jquery
3. CSS

#### How It Works

* It is choosing a random word from a list of around 5000 five letter words. 
* Then it prompts the player a 5x5 grid that allows them 5 chances to guess the word, providing them the only with the first letter as a clue.
* As the player guesses, the game responds by changing the color of each letter:
	* Green for the letter being the correct letter in the correct place.
	* Yellow for the letter being the correct letter in the wrong place.
	* Red for the letter being the wrong letter in the wrong place.
* The correct letters are transferred to the next row and the the player is prompted to guess again

#### Contribute 

* This game is challenging because of it's large database of words it draws from, would be helpful to add a dictionary feature.
* Also would be fun to be able to chose the length of word to guess from and have the board adjust accordingly.
